  "The perceived comfort is an individual matter for each of us. The designer's task is to ensure access to light that can be adjusted according to the user's needs.",
  "Excessive access to light can be regulated by using fixed elements, such as roofing elements, as well as movable elements, such as blinds, awnings, external and internal blinds.",
  "Daylight comfort can be described by various parameters, such as: Daylight Factor (DF), Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI), spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA), Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE).",
  "The method of measuring factors related to the comfort of users, as well as the impact of the building on the environment, is defined in multi-criteria certificates, such as BREEAM and LEED.",
  "According to the Polish building law, in a room intended for people, the ratio of the window area, calculated in the light of the frames, to the floor area should be at least 1:8.",
  "One way to ensure the access of daylight can be the use of roof skylights",
  "Visual comfort is only one of the components of user comfort. When designing, other factors influencing comfort, related to temperature, air quality or room acoustics, as well as all other functional, legal or economic conditions of the project should be taken into account"
